2. Consider a network 60.20.30.0/24. Computers within the network have the default gateway 60.20.30.1, which
is the ip of the router. The DNS server has the ip 60.20.30.2 and has the following entries in the DNS Table
google.ro 	120.30.4.5
mywebsite.ro	60.20.30.3
A computer having the ip 60.20.30.4 opens the web browser and visits the website mywebsite.ro.
What is the packet route through the network?

a) 60.20.30.4 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.3 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.3 -> 60.20.30.2 -> 60.20.30.4
b) 60.20.30.4 -> 60.20.30.2 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.3 -> 60.20.30.4 -> 60.20.30.2 -> 60.20.30.4
c) 60.20.30.4 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.2 -> 60.20.30.3 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.4
-corect d) 60.20.30.4 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.2 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.4 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.3 -> 60.20.30.1 -> 60.20.30.4

5. What is a datagram?
a) A structure used to get data from the user in order to synchronize the server
b) A basic transfer unit used in packet-switched networks, providing a connectionless comunnication service
c) Information that can harm your computer if you're not careful with it
d) Millions of bytes configured in a big cluster which can be easily transferred

6. ARP can be used for...
a) Mapping network addresses to physical (MAC) addresses
b) Mapping public virtual addresses to private ip addresses
c) Publishing websites to the internet
d) Sending emails very fast

7. TCP, UDP and SCTP are part of
a) Application Layer
b) Internet Layer
c) Transport Layer
d) Link Layer

8. TCP Header contains the following entries:
a) Source Port, Destination Port, Sequence Number, Acknowledgement Number, Flags, Data Offset, Checksum, Urgent Pointer
b) Source IP, Destination IP, Pointer to MAC address, Connection unique identifier, Router IP, NAT tables
c) Source Port, Destination Port, Length, Checksum
d) Source Mac, Destination Mac, Connection object, Checksum, Data hash

9. A company has three departments: Offices, Public and Managers.
The offices have 123 computers, Public Relationship has 30 computers and Managers have 6 computers.
The company wants to make a network such that:
	- every computer has access to internet
	- have minimum costs
	- it must be certainly known from which department some webpages are accesed from the HQ in another city
Provide a good configuration for these requirements:
a) 3 subnetworks, 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24 for every department and connect every subnet directly to the internet, using NAT, through a different provider
b) 3 subnetworks, 192.168.0.0/25, 192.168.0.128/27, 192.168.0.160/29 and connect them to a central router which translates all the ips on 192.168.0.0/24 with the ip 30.0.0.5
c) 1 subnetwork for all the company, 192.168.0.0/24, connect computers to internet through a router which translates every address ip to a public ip address with different class depending on department
d) 3 subnetworks, 192.168.0.0/25, 192.168.0.128/27, 192.168.0.160/29, one router which translates first network to 30.0.0.1, second to 30.0.0.2, and third to 30.0.0.3

10. What would be a network security recommandation?
a) Forwarding all traffic from the router ports to computer ports
b) Activate firewall and use good firewall rules
c) Use the default router password, everybody will expect that you change it, so not changing it is a good strategy
d) Allow RDP connections on your computers

11. What is DSL and what it is used for?
a) Digital Subscriber Line; used to give access to internet through telephone lines
b) Digital Supplier Limit; verifies if the maximum connected users in a wi-fi network has been reached
c) Describer Serial Link; used for serial cables to assure their connectivity in a network
d) Destination Source Limit; limits the number of packets sent and received, used for security reasons

12. What is the difference between a switch and a hub?
a) The hub sends a packet specifically to an end point or more, the switch broadcasts the message to all the network
b) The switch sends a packet specifically to an end point or more, the hub broadcasts the message to all the network
c) The hub can send packets on large distances, but the switch is generally for home usage
d) There is no difference
