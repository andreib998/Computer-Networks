Wiki:
An Ethernet crossover cable is a crossover cable for Ethernet used to connect computing devices together directly. It is 
most often used to connect two devices of the same type, e.g. two computers (via their network interface controllers) or 
two switches to each other. By contrast, patch cables or straight through cables are used to connect devices of different 
types, such as a computer to a network switch or Ethernet hub.
